# Contributing

Thanks for helping build MWV.

## Workflow

- Create a feature branch from `main`.
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before submitting a PR.
- Include Supabase migrations when altering the database schema.

## Commit style

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.
