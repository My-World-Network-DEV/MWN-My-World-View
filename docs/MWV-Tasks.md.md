# MWV Development Task List: Enhanced Project Plan with Critical Additions

## Executive Summary

This enhanced task list incorporates critical missing components identified through comprehensive repository analysis and aligns with MWV's civic engagement mission. Based on the current project state (5-band stance census, basic Supabase integration, Next.js 15 with App Router), this updated plan addresses democratic governance, evidence-first principles, and accessibility compliance within the 12-week MVP timeline.

**Key Updates**: Democratic governance moved to Phase 2, evidence system prioritized, real-time features scoped for MVP viability, AI features postponed to Phase 5, desktop-first approach with basic mobile responsive design, and accessibility integration throughout all phases rather than concentrated in Phase 6.

**Repository State**: The project has foundational infrastructure with stance events, census tracking, and basic Motion pages implemented. This plan builds upon existing components while adding missing civic engagement features essential for democratic discourse.

## Critical Integration Points *(NEW SECTION)*

### Cross-Phase Dependencies & Democratic Values

**Governance ‚Üî All Features**: Forum systems and democratic decision-making integrate with every entity type (Topics, Issues, Motions, Positions, Debates, Solutions), ensuring community governance is fundamental rather than peripheral.

**Evidence ‚Üî Arguments**: Credibility scoring directly affects argument quality metrics, creating feedback loops that encourage evidence-first discourse and reward high-quality source citation.

**Real-time ‚Üî Collaboration**: Position room updates, forum discussions, and collaborative editing depend on optimized real-time infrastructure that scales from simple stance updates to complex multi-user interactions.

**Privacy ‚Üî Democratic Participation**: Anonymous stance handling affects every user interaction while maintaining the ability to track consensus and prevent manipulation, balancing privacy with democratic transparency.

### Technical Debt Prevention Strategies

**Database Schema Front-Loading**: All governance, evidence, and privacy schema changes implemented in Phase 1 to avoid complex migrations that could disrupt civic discussions and data integrity.

**Component Accessibility Built-In**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance integrated from component creation rather than retrofitted, ensuring democratic participation is accessible to all citizens from day one.

**API Design for Future AI**: REST endpoints designed to support future AI integration without immediate implementation, allowing for transparent AI assistance when community governance approves.

**Real-time Architecture Scaling**: Infrastructure designed to scale from simple consensus updates to complex collaborative features without requiring fundamental rewrites.

### Success Metrics by Phase *(Enhanced with Civic KPIs)*

**Phase 1**: Schema supporting full civic hierarchy, privacy controls functional, accessibility foundations tested with assistive technologies

**Phase 2**: Democratic governance proposals flowing through community forums, Position Rooms enabling collaborative thesis development, content creation supporting evidence attachment

**Phase 3**: Multi-stance debates active with evidence curation, real-time consensus tracking accurate, community moderation reducing harmful content while preserving democratic discourse

**Phase 4**: Solution workflows enabling civic action, data export supporting research and transparency, analytics providing insights into democratic health

**Phase 5**: AI summarization improving comprehension of complex debates, transparency systems maintaining trust in AI assistance, cost controls preventing resource abuse

**Phase 6**: Desktop experience supporting complex civic workflows, WCAG AA compliance verified by disabled users, mobile enabling basic participation

**Phase 7**: Diverse community actively engaged in democratic processes, moderation maintaining civility without suppressing dissent, platform stable under civic discussion load

---

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning *(Updated)*

### High-Risk Areas & Mitigation Strategies

1. **Democratic Governance Complexity**: Start with simple majority voting and 1-5 sliders, defer quadratic voting to post-MVP to ensure governance functions without overwhelming complexity

2. **Evidence System Scaling**: Begin with community-driven credibility scoring, avoid complex AI fact-checking integration until user patterns and community standards are established

3. **Real-time Performance Under Civic Load**: Implement graceful degradation for high-traffic debates, use caching for census calculations, and queue non-critical updates

4. **Mobile Complexity vs Civic Depth**: Prioritize desktop for MVP where complex hierarchical discourse thrives, ensure mobile supports basic participation without sacrificing civic depth

5. **Community Moderation Balance**: Design transparent appeal processes and community governance of moderation policies to prevent both under-moderation and over-censorship

### Scope Flexibility for Democratic Values

**Must-Have (Democratic Core)**: Position rooms, governance forums, evidence attachment, stance tracking, basic moderation, accessibility compliance

**Should-Have (Democratic Enhancement)**: Advanced analytics, solution tracking, data export, community health metrics, collaborative editing

**Could-Have (Future Democracy)**: AI fact-checking, quadratic voting, complex visualization, extensive third-party integrations, advanced mobile features

**Won't-Have (Out of Scope)**: Enterprise features, complex gamification, non-civic social features, proprietary closed systems

### Community-Centered Launch Strategy

**Pre-Launch (Weeks 10-12)**: Beta testing with diverse civic groups, seed content creation, community guidelines development through democratic process

**Launch (Week 12)**: Soft launch with invited civic organizers and engaged citizens, gradual public opening based on moderation capacity and community health

**Post-Launch (Weeks 13+)**: Community-driven feature prioritization, democratic governance of platform evolution, expansion based on successful civic outcomes
