# MWV Development Task List: Comprehensive High-Level Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive task list bridges the gap between current project needs and the ambitious 12-week MVP timeline starting August 25, 2025. Based on extensive research into modern debate platforms, AI-assisted development practices, and the specified tech stack (Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase), this plan provides actionable high-level tasks organized by the seven development phases.

**Key Insight**: The MWV project has the potential to synthesize proven debate platform approaches (Kialo's argument mapping, Decidim's participatory democracy, ChangeMyView's consensus mechanisms) into a comprehensive structured discourse platform using modern AI-assisted development practices.

**Note on Repository Analysis**: Direct access to the GitHub repository was not available during research. This plan assumes a greenfield Next.js project and includes foundation setup tasks that can be adapted based on existing repository state.
