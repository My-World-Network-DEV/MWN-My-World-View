# MWV Pages and Components: Descriptions and

# Purposes v

This document provides a concise description and purpose for each page and component in the
My World View (MWV) project. Descriptions summarize the UI/UX, functionality, and key
elements based on the project's vision (e.g., structured debates from micro-posts, evidence
focus, stance system) and current repo state (e.g., scaffolds with Supabase). Purposes explain
the role in user flows, aligning with goals like civic discourse, escalation from posts to solutions,
and community collaboration. This is designed for an AI coding agent to reference when
implementing or extending code, ensuring consistency with Next.js App Router, Tailwind, and
Supabase patterns.
The content has been reorganized from the original "MWV_ Pages and Components v1.pdf" by
consolidating duplicate descriptions (e.g., merging variant details for Position Card and Motion
Card), removing redundancies, and grouping logically under Pages and Components. Headers
for missing pages and components (sourced from the project state, code document, and master
document) have been added as skeletons with placeholders for descriptions and purposes.

## Pages

## layout.tsx (root layout)

- **Description** : A global wrapper for all pages, including HTML structure, metadata, global
    CSS imports, and an accessibility skip link (hidden until focused). It sets dark mode class
    and base styles.
- **Purpose** : Ensures consistent site-wide layout, accessibility (e.g., skip to main content),
    and performance (SSR base) while wrapping child pages.The layout.tsx file serves
    as the root layout for all pages in the My World View (MWV) project.
-
- **Description:**
- This file acts as a global wrapper, meaning it encloses all other page content. It's
    responsible for defining the fundamental HTML structure of the application, incorporating
    essential metadata (like title, description, and viewport settings), and importing global
    CSS styles that apply across the entire site. A key accessibility feature included is a
    "skip link," which is hidden by default but becomes visible and focusable when a user
    navigates with a keyboard, allowing them to quickly jump to the main content area.
    Additionally, layout.tsx is where the dark mode class is set and base styles are
    established, providing a foundational visual theme for the application.
-
- **Purpose:**


- The primary purpose of layout.tsx is to guarantee a consistent site-wide layout. By
    wrapping all child pages, it ensures that elements like headers, footers, and global
    styling are uniformly applied. It significantly contributes to accessibility by implementing
    features like the "skip to main content" link, which benefits users relying on keyboard
    navigation or screen readers. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in performance by
    enabling Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for the base structure of the application, which
    can improve initial page load times and search engine optimization.
**Implemented Components:**
● **ThemeToggle:** Integrated globally to set dark mode class, allowing theme switching
across all wrapped pages without page-specific variations.
**Unimplemented Components:**
● **ModalDialog:** Could be used for site-wide dialogs like login prompts, but not yet
integrated; would appear as an overlay on any child page.
